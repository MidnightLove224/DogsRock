    <H2>You can baby your dog as you would a sick child and give him homemade
    food such as boiled potatoes, rice and well-cooked, skinless chicken.
    In certain situations, your dog may require fluid therapy, antibiotics,
    a change in diet, antiemetics (drugs to help control vomiting) or other medication.Heres some examples..
    As responsible pet owners, we must observe and understand signs of common dog illnesses and make sure our buddies get the proper health treatment to get them back into shape. If you are a new dog owner and want to do your best for the wellbeing of your new friends, let’s review 10 common dog illnesses and how to treat them properly.</h2>




<h2>1. Ear Infections
Probably the most prevalent common dog illnesses are ear infections, as they affect both the apartment dogs and the backyard(the backround most likey cause they are outside more)  ones. Some of the most common causes are ear mites, yeast, bacteria, ear canal hair growth, allergies, colds and so on. Symptoms include:

Vigorous ear scratching
Head shaking
Vulnerability and crying at ear touch
Redness of the ear canal
Swelling of the outer areas of the ear
Crying
If your dog shows such symptoms, you are in your right to suspect an ear infection. Use a cotton ball (but never a Q-Tip) and a gentle non-alcoholic cleansing solution to clean the ear. While it is better to prevent ear infections than to treat them, always go to the vet to assess the situation, as ear infections can lead to more serious health problems.</h2>

<h2>2. Digestive Problems Including Vomiting and Diarrhea

While an isolated case of vomiting or diarrhea shouldn’t worry you, recurrent such episodes should be supervised closely. If your dog vomits several times a day or presents diarrhea for more than a day, you should also consider the following symptoms:

Black or dark diarrhea
Loss of appetite
Presence of blood in the vomit or stool
Lethargy
Crying of pain
Fever
There are many causes of gastrointestinal diseases, including but not limited to, improper foods, pancreatitis, allergies, food poisoning, swallowed objects, a bacterial infection and so on. Before going to the vet, try a few home remedies:

Give the dog plenty of water to combat dehydration
Provide the dog rice water to drink – boil one cup of white rice in water, rinse and let the liquid cool, then give it to your dog.
Give your dog a suspension of water and PeptoBismol
A spoon of yogurt will help with the intestinal flora balance.</h2>


<h2>3.A skin tag can look frightening for both people and pets. </h2>

Before you fear the worst, remember that cancerous tags usually look like lesions, leak liquid and change color and size. Skin tags are not painful and don’t make the dog suffer. There are plenty of home remedies for dogs’ skin tags, and you should try some of them without worrying. If the tag is painful or it looks more like a disease than a wart, take your buddy to the doctor.

<h2>4. Worms of All Kinds
Dogs and internal parasites are sworn enemies, but the truth is that almost all dogs deal with such a threat at least once in their lifetime. There are many kind of worms that dogs attract, and some of them (hookworms) can be fatal in puppies. If your dog suffers from a worm infestation, some of the symptoms include:

Scooting on its bottom
Loss of appetite
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Weight loss
Lethargy / or unexplained agitation
Dryness of the coat
It is not recommended to treat worms on your own. Medicine that kills some of the worms may not kill the other species. There are, however, some remedies that will help the dog feel better until you take it to the vet.

If your dog accepts some garlic in the food mix a crushed garlic clove in the food
Introduce raw chopped/grated carrots in the food
Mince pumpkin seeds in its food</h2>
 
<h2>5. Allergic Dermatitis

Your pet’s skin should not be flaky, reddish in color, itching, irritated, too dry or too oily or present hair loss patches. These are all signs of allergic dermatitis – caused by many factors including allergies, infections, hormonal imbalances or parasites. The best treatment is got at the vet, as he can diagnose the cause and prescribe an efficient treatment.

However, skin conditions in dogs can be controlled through nutrition. Make sure your dog receives proper quantities of protein, anti-oxidants, and essential fatty acids. Never forget about the preventative methods against fleas and ticks.</h2>
    
<h2>6. Dental Diseases
If you heard many times that you should give your dog rawhide chews and teeth-cleaning toys and products, you heard this for all the good reasons. Dental diseases in dogs can also be linked to diabetes, heart diseases, kidney problems, and many more – so you really need to take care of your dog’s teeth. Common symptoms include:

Smelly breath
Eating and chewing difficulties
Pain
Swollen face
Head shaking
The treatment of a dog’s periodontitis should be performed by a specialist. However, you can try to brush your dog’s teeth (but WITHOUT human toothpaste as it is highly toxic to dogs; use dog toothpaste instead). You can also feed your dog hard foods: raw carrots if it likes them, chewable bones and toys with tooth cleaning properties.</h2>
