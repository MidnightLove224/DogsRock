    <h2>1. Is it a duck…or a dog? The Newfoundland breed has a water resistant
    coat and webbed feet. This dog was originally bred to help haul nets for 
    fishermen and rescuing people at risk of drowning.</h2>
    <h2>2. It pays to be a lap dog. Three dogs (from First Class cabins!) 
    survived the sinking of the Titanic – two Pomeranians and one Pekingese.</h2>
    <h2>3. A Beatles hit. It’s rumored that, at the end of the Beatles song, 
    “A Day in the Life,” Paul McCartney recorded an ultrasonic whistle, 
    audible only to dogs, just for his Shetland sheepdog.</h2>
    <h2>4. Wow, check out those choppers! Puppies have 28 teeth and normal
    adult dogs have 42</h2>
    <h2>5. Chase that tail! Dogs chase their tails for a variety of reasons: 
    curiosity, exercise, anxiety, predatory instinct or, they might have fleas! </h2>
    <h2>6. Seeing spots? Or not… Dalmatian puppies are pure white when they are 
    born and develop their spots as they grow older.</h2>
    <h2>7. Dogs do dream! Dogs and humans have the same type of slow wave sleep 
    (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) and during this REM stage dogs can dream. 
    The twitching and paw movements that occur during their sleep are signs that
    your pet is dreaming</h2>
    <h2>8. No night vision goggles needed! Dogs’ eyes contain a special membrane,
    called the tapetum lucidum, which allows them to see in the dark.</h2>
    <h2>9. Pitter patter. A large breed dog’s resting heart beats between 60
    and 100 times per minute, and a small dog breed’s heart beats between 100-140.
    Comparatively, a resting human heart beats 60-100 times per minute.</h2>
    <h2>11. It’s not a fever…A dog’s normal temperature is between 101 and 102.5
    degrees Fahrenheit. How much do you know about dog health?</h2>
    <h2>12. Is something wet? Unlike humans who sweat everywhere, dogs only 
    sweat through the pads of their feet.</h2>
    <h2>13. Here’s looking at you. Dogs have three eyelids, an upper lid, 
    a lower lid and the third lid, called a nictitating membrane or “haw,”
    which helps keep the eye moist and protected.</h2>
    <h2>14. Americans love dogs! 62% of U.S. households own a pet, which equates
    to 72.9 million homes</h2>
    <h2>15.Breathe easy. In addition to sweating through their paw pads, dogs pant 
    to cool themselves off. A panting dog can take 300-400 breaths (compared to 
    his regular 30-40) with very little effort.</h2>
    <h2>16.Express yourself. Dogs’ ears are extremely expressive. It’s no wonder!
    There are more than a dozen separate muscles that control a dog’s ear movements.</h2>
    <h2>17.It’s not so black and white. It’s a myth that dogs only see in black and white.
    In fact, it’s believed that dogs see primarily in blue,
    greenish-yellow, yellow and various shades of gray.</h2>
