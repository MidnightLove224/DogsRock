  <h2>Hi my name is Alexa  and I made this website at 11 years old</h2>
  <p>Its about dogs, so.. hope you like it!</p>

  

    
<h1>Why you should have a dog</h1>
<h2> You should have a dog because you will be walking your dog as a family,
you'll all gain more exercise.
And, you'll develop a strong bond with your pet, which decreases stress 
(more exercise and less stress = a healthier heart). 
Certain breeds of dogs are ideal if you feel your child needs a companion,
mainly for social and health reasons.
Dogs are cute a cuddly and a great companian for your kids to play with and have fun 
and never be bored around the house.I dont have a dog,but I sure would like one!
I need to convince my mom though...Dogs are awesome and I hope thius webpage will
convince you to get a dog. I spent a lonnnnnnnnnng time on this website and it would
pain me if I did not get a dog.</h2>
